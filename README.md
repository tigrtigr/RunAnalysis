This repo includes:

- means.txt - data set containing means for a selection of variables from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones 		Data Set (further information in CodeBook.txt)

- run_analysis.R - R script that does the following:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 3) Labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 4) Labels activities with descriptive activity names. 5) Creates an independent data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Running the script requires the complete data set, which can be found here:
